## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here
    My project is to create a crowdfunding website that's dedicated to helping individuals pay off their student loans. The site allows for an individual with student loans to make an account and a payment plan determined by income and total student loans. Once the user has made an account, they have the ability to earn points through various activities (such as watching sponsor's commercials or taking product surveys). At the end of every quarter, the individuals with the most points will have their loans paid off until the funds are gone. Their will also be an option for individuals to make donations without having an account(anonymous). The Site will also include education tailored towards helping people understand student loans as a way to prevent more people from getting trapped.
